We present to you the new, improved graphical design of \theJournal. Designed in \LaTeX.

\begin{enumerate}
        \item Please check that your name + credentials + emails + phone numbers, etc. are spelled/entered correctly;
    \item Please provide the name of your institution if not printed next to your department;
    \item Please provide your ORCID-iD, and indicate to me if no such ID exists and I will delete the ORCID-logo at your name (or make an orcid-id at www.orcid.org);
    \item Please check that your main title and all sectional titles and subtitles are typeset correctly --- remember that in English, French, etc., every word in a title should be capitalized except for articles, particles, and conjunctions. Even in that case, important words central to the meaning of the title and 5-letter words or longer must always be capitalized in English titles (Germanic languages, such as German and Danish, are exceptions to this rule, and titles in these languages follow normal sentence case).
    \\From Grammarly.com: "Capitalize the first word of the title, the last word of the title, and all nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, subordinating conjunctions, and a few conjunctions. Prepositions are only capitalized if they are used adjectivally or adverbially.";
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item Please check if section titles are correctly typeset in the correct font size; main sections must be typeset in a larger size (H1) than subordinate section titles (H2, H3, etc.);
        \item Do indicate if some titles should be italicized instead of bolded (\textit{please bear in mind the overall aesthetics, not limited to your article alone, when asking for font size changes.});
        \item Generally, the first line in the paragraph succeeding a blockquote is not indented when that paragraph naturally follows from the paragraph preceding the blockquote.
        \\However, if you would like indentation after some blockquotes where the above is not the case, please indicate so;
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Please indicate if any text has gone missing, and if some text has erroneously not been bolded or italicized (note that all footnotes are now endnotes)
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{For example, the use of certain system characters, such as \&, \%, \#, \_, \$, \^{}, and other special characters, can make text go missing. If you have used these characters, please double-check that I have caught it and that no text is missing};
        \item Especially, check the above if you have any URLs in the text, footnotes, or in the list of references, because URLs often contain these characters;
        \end{itemize}
    \item Please write acknowledgements, if any --- otherwise indicate to delete this section;
    \item All authors must append a mini-biography for insertion in the \textit{About the Author(s)}--section after the article. Please write a little of yourself, your current work, or otherwise;
    \item Please see annotations in the margin (bolded and \textcolor{red}{\textbf{red}}) and follow instructions;
    \item Spell-check your article;
    \item And also please note if you notice any overall inconsistencies with the design --- it's a work-in-progress :) \textellipsis

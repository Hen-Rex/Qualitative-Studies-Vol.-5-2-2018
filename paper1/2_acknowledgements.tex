The idea to the theme of the collected papers of this special issue is the result of research presentations and discussions at the workshop \enquote{Change and continuities at the intersections of welfare domains: Ethnographic insights into the wider impact of public sector reforms?}. This workshop was held in November 2017 and hosted by the \textit{Ethnographic Research into Public Sector Reform Network}. The network was funded by the  \textit{Independent Research Fund Denmark}.

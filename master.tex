% THIS DOCUMENT WAS TYPESET IN LATEX ON OVERLEAF BY HENRIK PLØGER STOUGAARD NIELSEN OF AALBORG UNIVERSITY. CONTACT ME ON hpsn17@student.aau.dk IF NECESSARY.
%
% THIS DOCUMENT USES THE FOLLOWING COMPILATION SETTINGS TO WORK:
%   COMPILER: LuaLaTeX
%   MAIN DOCUMENT: master.tex
%
% BEFORE HANDING IN FINAL DRAFT:
%   Write 'final' in place of 'draft' in '\documentclass'.
%   Remove [showframe] in the \geometry package. It is to see margins drawn out.
%   Compile at least 5 times to make document look nice.
%
% Husk at ændre i headers i alle pagestyles (lige/ulige sider), så antal forfattere passer.

%% DOCUMENT SETUP & LAYOUT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\documentclass[12pt,a4paper,article,openany,openbib,twoside,final]{memoir}
    % final can be replaced by draft to speed up compilation time, shows placeholders.
    % remember, that hyperref is not loaded in draft mode, so URLs don't work.

\usepackage[]{geometry} % SKAL KOMME FØR setlrmarginsadnblock og FØR \checkandfixthelayout. Package option: [showframe], som viser marginerne afmærket.
%
\usepackage{marginnote} % marginnotes that do not run off page
    \renewcommand*{\marginfont}{\sffamily\tiny\bfseries\color{red}}
%
\setlrmarginsandblock{20mm}{20mm}{*} % Margins {inner}{outer}
\setulmarginsandblock{20mm}{20mm}{*} % Margins {top}{bottom}
\checkandfixthelayout % Must come last after all design changes
\setheaderspaces{*}{9mm}{*} % sets spacing between header line and text
    \newcommand*{\titlepagevspace}{+20mm}
%\raggedbottomsection % fix layout, instead of raggedbottom
%
\SingleSpacing % line-spacing, alternatively \SingleSpacing
